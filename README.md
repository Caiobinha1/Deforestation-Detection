# Deforestation Sound Detection Project

This project provides a complete pipeline for creating a custom audio dataset and classifying environmental sounds related to deforestation. It is organized into two main parts: a dataset validation and generation suite, and a fine-tuned machine learning model for inference.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders, each with a specific purpose.

Dataset_validation/

    Mix_Audios.py (Script to generate new audio clips)

    Raw_Audios/ (Folder for all source audio clips)

        Chainsaw/

        Engine/

        Fire/

        Footsteps/

        Forest_Ambiance/

        HandSaw/

        Rain/

        Thunderstorm/

    Generated_Audios/ (Output folder for mixed audio)

Fine-tuned_Model/

    yamnet-transfer-learning-on-esc50.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook for model training)

    batch_inference.py (Script to classify a folder of audio)

    esc50_forest.h5 (The trained Keras model file)

### Workflow and Usage

Generate the Dataset:
The first step is to create a realistic dataset by mixing foreground sounds (e.g., a chainsaw) with background sounds (e.g., a forest ambiance).

Run the Script: Execute the mixing script from the project's root directory.

Follow Prompts: The script will ask you for the paths to the two source folders and a path for the output. The newly created audio files will be saved in Dataset_validation/Generated_Audios/.

Understand the Model (Optional)
If you want to see how the model was trained and fine-tuned:

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook located at Fine-tuned_Model/yamnet-transfer-learning-on-esc50.ipynb.

The final, trained model used by the inference script is Fine-tuned_Model/esc50_forest.h5.

Step 3: Classify Audio
Use the trained model to classify the sounds in your generated dataset or any other audio folder.

Run the Script: Execute the batch inference script from the project's root directory.
